<h1>Eyeballs Following Cursor</h1>
  <p>This project features a fun interactive element where a pair of eyeballs follow the cursor as it moves around the screen. It's a simple yet engaging demonstration of mouse tracking using basic HTML and JavaScript.</p>
  <h2>How it Works:</h2>
  <p>The JavaScript code utilizes the <code>document.onmousemove</code> event to continuously update the position of the eyeballs based on the cursor's coordinates. By dynamically adjusting the position of the eyeballs relative to the cursor's position, the illusion of the eyes following the cursor is achieved.</p>
